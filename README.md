## Factions

Factions are used to tell when to apply extra damage to the mob. For example if the mob is in the faction "boss" then extra damage will be applied based on a placeholder such as %player_stat_boss_damage_bonus%. A mob can be in multiple factions, if the faction setting is for example boss,fire both bonuses will be applied.

### IsInFactionCondition

Checks if the boss is in a faction taking into account that it could be in multiple seperated by comma
```
?isinfaction{faction=}
```
