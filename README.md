An extension for MythicMobs that adds some Mechanics, Targeters, Conditions and utilises the faction feature to apply bonus damage to mobs.

## Getting Started

This assumes you have basic knowledge of how to use Mythic, if you do please take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/bedwarshurts/AlchemistMMExtension/wiki) for everything this extension offers.

## Building

Building is as simple as cloning the project then running maven install. However the mythicdungeons related mechanics conditions etc won't be included. To include them you need to a local copy of mythicdungeons. If you do have one, make a libs folder just outside the project folder, place mythicdungeons jar there and uncomment the commented code.
